# Weekend Challenge: Full-Stack To-Do List

## Description

Duration: 16 hour sprint

Over the course of a weekend I got to dive into my very first Full-Stack web application: a simple but useful to-do list! This application allows users to create, view, complete, and delete to-dos. The to-do items are stored in a database, ensuring that tasks persist across sessions.

## Demo

## Usage
This application was designed to help with task management and to-do organization. Tasks will persist across sessions!

* View To-Dos: Easily see a table of existing to-dos.
* Mark as Complete: Track your progress by clicking the check button to complete tasks. Completed tasks will turn green and display the time marked complete.
* Delete To-Dos: Remove tasks that are no longer needed with the delete button.
* Add New To-Dos: Insert new to-dos with by adding descriptive text and hitting 'Create'.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js
* PG
* Express
* Database manager

## Installation

* [Fill this in later]

## Developer Notes
This is the first version of my to-do application. As I learn more, I plan to revisit the project to refactor. I would also like to implement a way to track the total amount of tasks completed, as well as explore methods of notifications, and creating graphics that celebrate a completed to-do.
